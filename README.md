# EPQ
Arguing for a morality based on firm foundations.
Sections:
 - Why this is needed in the first place (Nietzsche/Dostoyevsky's observations on the fall of religion -> morality)
 - How a foundation for morality can be made, through the meaning in myth/religion (explaining why one single person's idea is bound to be flawed, how myth/religion is in a moral landscape, how we have evolved to appropach a single ideal)
 - How myth/religion can be interpreted (refuting postmodernism's claim through the idea that only a very few moral interpretations work [common sense + Piaget], how interpretations that are true in many layers of analysis are hardly going to be coincidence)
 - Giving an example of the above: interpreting the Enuma Elis
