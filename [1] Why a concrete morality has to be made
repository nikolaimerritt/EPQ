[1] Why a concrete morality has to be made.
"God is dead." One of the most misunderstood quotes in the 20th century. Proud atheists and edgy teenagers smugly proclaim Friedrich Nietzsche's famous phrase, adding another layer of tarnish to it as they do so. For, to the German philosopher, it couldn't be further from the triumphant battlecry it's now only ever used as. It was a lament, a horror-filled lament, for what he thought would be the inevitable consequence of Western society's abandonment of religion. 
"But how did we do this? What were we doing when we unchained the earth from its sun?", he writes, in the very same passage. "Whither are we moving? Are we not plunging continually? Is there still any up or down? Are we not straying, as through an infinite nothing?"
