Plan:
 - Death of God (Nietzsche [specifically, "The Gay Science"], Dostoyevsky [specifically, "Crime and Punishment"])
 - Its implications (however, mentioned above too)

Ultimately, I aim for this essay to be very practical. Despite its topic being very abstract and seemingly divorced from day-to-day reality, it is only so because of how seeped it is in practicality. The question of morality -- how should I act? -- addresses literaly everything we people do, have done, and ever will do. And in order to embrace that, to look at "right action" as a whole, an abstract stance must be taken. So, reader, when you read through this essay bear in mind that, in a sense, this aims to be one of the most practical things you will ever read. 

Given such a realistic mindset, a very legitimate question when faced with this essay is "why should I care?". "I'm not a complete idiot", you might object. "My life's going just fine, thank you very much. I don't need to be told how to behave". And that might be a perfectly valid point; if you're God incarnate, then maybe you do have nothing you could possibly do better. But realistically speaking (and I'm being serious here) we have no idea how much better the world would be if everyone straightened themselves out more, even by just a fraction. 

But more importantly, although the ideas in this essay are meant to be implementable, this isn't a self-help book. This is far more all-embracing, abstract, and deep. And so is the primary reason for me writing this. 

The way I see it, western society is greatly imbalanced. In its hurried pursuit for scientific knowledge and its fruits, it has lost sight of the bigger picture. There are not one, but two types of knowledge society needs to provide for its people: factual, scientific truth; and pragmatic, moral wisdom. And there really is a divide between the two. No matter how many experiments you conduct, you'll learn nothing about the difference between right and wrong. No matter how many scientific journals you read, you'll learn nothing about how to make the proper sacrifices in your life. No matter how many physics equations you solve, you'll learn nothing about how to be the best person you could be. In short: no matter how factually clever you are, that'll gain you no moral wisdom. 

Furthermore, science can *never* give us a complete moral view. Yes, science is great at advising us on our already existing moral ideas, but it can't come up with a complete view from scratch. For example, imagine you're a  politician deciding how to spend the tax budget on education  Researches can tell 
 - detail is/ought realms
 - is: science; ought: religion/myth <-- scientific truth incredibly new
 - issue with science ripping out religion from culture




<This bit can come later. Needs setting up>
Nietzsche famously observed the demise of religion almost 150 years ago in his book "The Gay Science". Through his character of the madman, Nietzsche proclaims: "Where is God? I'll tell you! We have killed him -- you and I!". Many people read this as a triumphant battle cry, but for the genius, this was a wail of horror and lament. "What were we doing when we unchained this earth from its sun? Are we not continually falling? Is there still an up and a down? Aren't we straying as though through an infinite nothing?". Nietzsche noticed that our society -- all societies, in fact -- are, at their core, deeply rooted in religion. And, for the scientific mind to start to
