Plan:
 - Death of God (Nietzsche [specifically, "The Gay Science"], Dostoyevsky [specifically, "Crime and Punishment"])
 - Its implications (however, mentioned above too)

Ultimately, I aim for this essay to be very practical. Despite its topic being very abstract and seemingly divorced from day-to-day reality, it is only so because of how seeped it is in practicality. The question of morality -- how should I act? -- addresses literaly everything we people do, have done, and ever will do. And in order to embrace that, to look at "right action" as a whole, an abstract stance must be taken. So, reader, when you read through this essay bear in mind that, in a sense, this aims to be one of the most practical things you will ever read. 

Given such a realistic mindset, a very legitimate question when faced with this essay is "why should I care?". "I'm not a complete idiot", you might object. "My life's going just fine, thank you very much. I don't need to be told how to behave". And that might be a perfectly valid point; if you're God incarnate, then maybe you do have nothing you could possibly do better. But realistically speaking (and I'm being serious here) we have no idea how much better the world would be if everyone straightened themselves out more, even by just a fraction. 

But more importantly, although the ideas in this essay are meant to be implementable, this isn't a self-help book. This is far more all-embracing, abstract, and deep. And so is the primary reason for me writing this. 

The way I see it, western society is greatly imbalanced. In its hurried pursuit for scientific progress and its fruits, it has lost sight of the bigger picture. There are two types of knowledge that people need to have: knowledge concerned with what there *is*; and knowledge concerned with what there *ought to be*. 
The former -- the world of "what there is" -- lays out the objective, scientific world. This is no doubt an incredibly useful class of information; our lives and achievements have been greatly enriched by it. But that doesn't mean it gives you the *full* view. In order to make science as objective as possible, it, by definition, has to ignore everything subjective. And to ignore the subjective is to ignore the deeply human. Pure science can't give us a complete idea of how to have a wholesome relationship, for example. Or how to be a good person. What to do when you're facing the unknown. What the meaning of life is. In short: how to act. 
To answer these questions, we have another form of truth: what there ought to be. Goals, tools, vividity, etc. All cultures have to be grounded in this one, not the scientific one.

<This bit can come later. Needs setting up>
Nietzsche famously observed the demise of religion almost 150 years ago in his book "The Gay Science". Through his character of the madman, Nietzsche proclaims: "Where is God? I'll tell you! We have killed him -- you and I!". Many people read this as a triumphant battle cry, but for the genius, this was a wail of horror and lament. "What were we doing when we unchained this earth from its sun? Are we not continually falling? Is there still an up and a down? Aren't we straying as though through an infinite nothing?". Nietzsche noticed that our society -- all societies, in fact -- are, at their core, deeply rooted in religion. And, for the scientific mind to start to
