[1] Why a concrete morality has to be made.
"God is dead." One of the most misunderstood quotes in the 20th century. Proud atheists and edgy teenagers smugly proclaim Friedrich Nietzsche's famous phrase, adding another layer of tarnish to it as they do so. For, to the German philosopher, it couldn't be further from the triumphant battlecry it's now only ever used as. It was a lament, a horror-filled lament, for what he thought would be the inevitable consequence of Western society's abandonment of religion. 

"But how did we do this? What were we doing when we unchained the earth from its sun?", he writes, in the very same passage {1}. "Whither are we moving? Are we not plunging continually? Is there still any up or down? Are we not straying, as through an infinite nothing?" 

On reading that, the obvious question is what did Nietzsche mean by all this? Where is this "infinite nothing" we're supposedly plunging through? It certainly isn't obvious it's present in my life, or (I hope) yours either. At face value -- and I'm not going to hide this -- it seems like an overdramatised, meaningless waffle. But let's not rush to overlook the philosopher's genius; it's only foolish to brush aside someone so influential and catalystic, despite the meaning in their words not being immediately obvious. In fact, the writer himself adressed this question, putting his imaginary auidence to the figure proclaiming the death of God exactly in our position:

"Here [the speaker] fell silent and looked again at his listeners; and they, too, were silent and stared at him in astonishment. 'I have come too early,' he said then; 'my time is not yet. This tremendous event is still on its way, still wandering; it has not yet reached the ears of men. Lightning and thunder require time; the light of the stars requires time; deeds, though done, still require time to be seen and heard.'" Although we may only see faint grey clouds above the horizon, the storm they herald is ensured. 

How can I be so certain? What will this storm look like, exactly? And, if I am right, what can be done about it? This, my reader, is the subject of the essay.

To explain all this rigorously, I must delve into the realm of history. It is no secret that, at the present day, science and religion are at war with each other. The claims of modern day religions oppose the truths science proposes, and so all of religion is thrown into question. But it wasn't always like this. It was only under five hundred years ago that the likes of Copernicus and Newton introduced refined scientific thought to the West {2} -- an unbelivably small amount in terms of humanity's history. If the development of the human mind took as long as a football match, then we've been thinking scientifically for less than the amount of time it takes for you to snap your fingers {3} {4}. We didn't evolve to talk about the world in terms of interpretationless objects, as science encourages us to. We saw the world in terms of getting from A to B: a world not of objects, but of tools. How could it be any different?

{4} Myself, using Audacity audio software to record the shortest time it took between two finger snaps out of four -- which, assuming the speed forwards and backwards across the thumb is equal, is the same time as a full finger snap. Result was 0.544 seconds. 90 minutes × 60 seconds per minute × 500 years / 7,000,000 years = a 0.386 seconds per 90 minutes ratio, so a finger snap is actually an overexaggeration.
