8th July:   Now that I have a lot more free time to start working on the EPQ, I plan to allot 90 minutes each day before lunch to it. I will aim to finish each of my 4 sections per week, allowing the final week of my summer holidays to go over my work and refine it. On reflection, the work I previously did was not relevant and focused on the title, due to my inability to dedicate much time and effort to it. I will restart from scratch, having learned the importance of keeping focused on the title. 

In the past, I listened to University lectures from Prof. Jordan Peterson from Toronto, which inspired this EPQ. I will continue doing this every weekday on the train to and from the gym, however, I will broaden my knowledge by listening to people questioning him in debates, and thinkers who take a different attitude to myth and religion. 

To write this, I will continue storing this EPQ on GitHub, because it easily shows you the history of the project you're working on. This will make showing evidence for my progress a lot easier. It's also easy to set up, free, and I already have an account for it. The only issue is that the content on it is publicly available. I'm not very comfortable with anyone online seeing unfinished, untidy versions of this, but I'll have to put up with that. The benefits greatly outweigh that cost. 

GitHub also allows me to post comments of my work once I've uploaded a new version. This will be useful, as it gives me an opportunity to easily assess my day's work, and think of things I did well, and ways to improve. I plan to use this feature with every new version.
